{: .prompt-tip }

I'm a software engineer by trade, and a tinkerer at heart. I love taking things apart to see how
they work, and (try to) put them back together. Its a lot easier to do this with software, which explains why my lazy self gravitated towards computers early in my childhood.

My interests vary from writing code to stargazing, from cooking to building my own electronic devices. This site is, more than anything, meant to serve as a personal record of my own experiments and thoughts. From time to time, I will try to clean up some of these ~~ramblings~~ thoughts and put it out for the world to criticize. Be gentle ðŸ˜„

On the professional front, I have experience as a full stack developer with a specialisation in data engineering. I'm currently working for one of India's largest FinTech startups. I think Open source software is the greatest idea ever, and generally contribute to the tools/frameworks I'm using, wherever I see some scope for improvement.
