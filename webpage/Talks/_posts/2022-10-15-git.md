In 2022, Sahaj Software conducted a Hacktoberfest [event](https://www.meetup.com/devday_chennai/events/294284799/) that aimed to get more people into
open source development and into programming in general. I gave a talk and conducted a hands-on workshop on using Git for a group of 20-30 people who were looking to get started with programming. I walked through why VCS platforms need to exist, Git's fundamental concepts and the typical flow of raising PRs to projects. By the end of the session, everyone had managed to raise a PR to GitHub's official [hello world repo](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife) ðŸ™Œ
