I gave a [talk](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dakshin-k-206675123_airflow-dataengineering-workflowautomation-activity-6969341481463558144-ifaO) at Cloudera's Chennai office on the use cases for Apache Airflow. Drawing heavily on my team's experiences building data platforms, I presented a sample use case and walked through a high level system design. 

We covered the guiding design principles behind the storage layer of the platform (covered in detail by my colleague [here](https://medium.com/inspiredbrilliance/data-storage-patterns-versioning-and-partitions-a8ce1fd82765)). We also looked at the evolution of the core abstraction used in all of the pipelines, from its humble beginnings as a single operator running for hours, to a fancy behemoth combining sensors and operators allowing us to run a huge number of pipelines without ever having to worry about Airflow's performance.

We also talked about issues like Observability, unit testing, health checks and data lineage. While the recording of the session was unfortunately never published, I'd recommend going through the slides as they are very self-explanatory. In case it wasn't clear, I'm quite proud of how this talk turned out ðŸ˜„
